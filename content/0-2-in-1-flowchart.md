# “An Engineer’s Search for Meaning” in One Flowchart



_“Concern for man and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors. Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and equations.”_

**― Albert Einstein, Quoted in "Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing our Digital Future" by Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson**



_“Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die, but long after we are gone be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistence.”_

**― Daniel Burnham, American architect**

Since I am an engineer, I like to draw diagrams / flowcharts to help me think and also to present my thinking to others.&#x20;

Here is a flowchart that captures how I have gone about deriving meaning, purpose and hope based on evidence and reason alone, starting from First Principles. (All the terms mentioned in the diagram are defined the book.)
