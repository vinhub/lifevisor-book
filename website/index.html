                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        The main message of the book is that it is possible to find meaning, purpose, and hope in life by following a principled, fact-based approach 
                        that relies on evidence and reason rather than faith or opinion.<br/><br/>
                        Of course, we all know that various people have tried this approach in the past and the results have not been great. 
                        So it is perfectly reasonable to be skeptical and ask what's different this time.<br/><br/>
                        Whenever something that has never worked before (such as heavier than air travel or remote communication) suddenly starts to work, it usually involves one of 2 things:<br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li>New knowledge or techniques</li>
                            <li>New attitude or way of looking at the problem</li>
                        </ul>
                        And I believe that we have made great strides in both of these areas fairly recently, enabling us to make another attempt at this problem. 
                        Allow me to show you how.

                        In the book, I develop a rigorous framework that I am calling the Meaning-Seeking Entities (MSE) Framework to define concepts like meaning, purpose and hope 
                        based purely on evidence and reason. I build the framework from First Principles, using a methodology I call Mindful Bounded Rationality (MBR).<br/><br/>
                        This methodology is based on the idea that while rationality is our best tool for understanding reality, it has real limitations which you simply can not ignore. 
                        This fact has been used by others to suggest that rationality is completely useless for this type of effort and hence one should go with far less
                        rigorous and unproven approaches! This is akin to throwing the baby out with the bathwater.<br/><br/>
                        In the book, I show ways of dealing with the limitations of rationality and still attain the intended goal.

                        The book uses a definition of "meaning in life" that is well established in scientific literature rather than relying on religious or poetic ideas. 
                        The concensus among psychologists is that meaning in life consists of 3 components:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Having a sense of coherence or comprehensibility in life</li>
                            <li>Having a sense of purpose in life</li>
                            <li>Having a sense that one's life matters or has existential significance</li>
                        </ul>
                        The book shows how one can attain meaning in life along all of these dimensions using the MSE Framework.

                        This is a great question (if I may say so myself!) The obvious reason is that I am an engineer myself. But it goes a lot deeper than that.<br/><br/>
                        Normally when people think of things like rationality and evidence and reason, they immediately think of science. And then they run into
                        the problems of limitations of science and rationality, such as the fact that reality is extremely complex and full of nebulosity and unknowns.
                        Science falls short when dealing with these aspects of reality.<br/><br/>
                        But engineering is a lot more than science. Engineering doesn't just deal with logic and abstractions, it occupies itself with the far more 
                        difficult task of bulding real working artifacts and solving real problems in the real world. 
                        This makes engineering uniquely capable of understanding and manipulating reality, which is crucial when talking about meaning, purpose and
                        hope in life.<br/><br/>
                        Of course, this argument gets a lot deeper and more complex than what can be described in an FAQ. You will need to read the book to appreciate it fully.

            <!-- Author Bio Text -->
            <h5>Vinayak (Vin) Bhalerao</h5>
            <p>I am a curious, open minded, unapologetically nerdy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinbhalerao/" target="_blank">software engineer / consultant</a>.</p> 
            <p>I was perfecly happy writing code for large corporations like Microsoft and Expedia until one day I realized that, for me, coding wasn't just something you 
                did for paying the bills. I felt that it had much wider applications. I started seeing code-like patterns in many day to day things, kind of like the movie Matrix. 
                These patterns weren't quite as well defined as computer code, but they weren't completely nebulous either. 
                I felt I had to try to capture them in some form and see what I could do with them.
            <p>So finally in my mid-life I started writing in English as an experiment to capture some of these patterns.</p>
                At first I wrote quick little pieces on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vin.bhalerao/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, 
                then graduated to a <a href="https://deepestturtle.com/" target="_blank">personal blog</a> (that no one read), 
                and then on to <a href="https://medium.com/@vinbhalerao" target="_blank">Medium</a>, where I was finally able to find some readers.
                After I had written about 50 blog posts, my chest filled up a little too much with pride and I mistakenly concluded that I was ready to write a whole book!</p>
            <p>(Just in case you didn't know, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect in psychology: It is a cognitive bias in which people with limited competence in 
                a particular domain overestimate their abilities. For more such enlightening nuggets of wisdom 
                that will turn you into the center of attention at parties, you may want to read my book.
                Don't overdo it though, or you may get yourself thrown out just when things start to get interesting! &#128515;)</p>
            <p>Anyway, the rest of the story of how this book came about is included in the book itself. Happy reading!</p>
