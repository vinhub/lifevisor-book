_To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment_

_Would you capture it or just let it slip?”_

## What Would You Do if You Had Only 5 Years to Live? <a href="#w8hg0mcetofw" id="w8hg0mcetofw"></a>

A few years ago, I asked myself the above question.

No, I wasn’t suffering from some terminal disease. Luckily what I had was something far more mundane and commonplace: a midlife crisis.

Lots of people go through it, of course. It's almost a rite of passage.&#x20;

Some people might suffer for a while, but most manage to make a complete recovery and move on as if nothing happened.

Except, in my case, things happened. Big things. Evidently so big that I ended up writing a book about deep things like meaning, purpose and hope in life, no less!

The kind of book that philosophers and poets and those who have actually gone through serious suffering in life are supposed to write. Not some guy who has writes code all day!

How does something like this happen?

Well, let me tell you about it, starting with some general observations about this supposedly innocuous condition known as midlife crisis.



It is commonly believed that you have one big bad crisis sometime in your 40’s, which makes you question everything you have done until then and whether thats' all there is.

And then, depending upon your circumstances, you either get a new car or a new career or a new carefree attitude towards life. Some people go totally crazy and buy a whole vineyard or something. And others just get seriously drunk.

This typically results in your big bad crisis getting replaced by a smaller one.&#x20;

Depending upon which remedy you followed, you either end up with buyer’s remorse or "grass looked greener" type disappointment or just a plain old hangover.&#x20;

Luckily, most of us are far more familiar with handling these types of minor crises, having experienced them multiple times in our lives by then.

Crisis solved, and life gets back to normal.



Unfortunately (or fortunately) for me, things didn’t quite work out like that.

In my case, instead of one big bad crisis, I had a series of bouts over a few years.&#x20;

This had the unexpected benefit that I got better and better at dealing with them each time around.

For example, I had already learned in previous bouts that buying a (slightly) speedier new car doesn’t quite work because cops take special delight in catching midlife crisis sufferers. Having spent a few nights in karaoke bars meant that I had already learned that singing, as a career, was just not on the cards for me. I was actually quite happy with my career as an engineer - I have always been a math / science nerd who liked to tinker with stuff.&#x20;

Also, I had spent enough time driving through wine country to know that owning a vineyard was back (and bank) breaking work.

In earlier bouts, I had also flipped through enough self help books in bookstores (remember those?) to know that the rational way of dealing with things like midlife crises was to clarify one's priorities in life by asking the hard question: What would I do if I had only 6 months to live? Whatever bubbled to the top of that list would be the things to focus on.

But once I had gotten over the dread and anxiety of having to ponder my own mortality, I had quickly realized that six months is such a short time that the answer turns out to actually be rather easy and commonplace.

For most people, their 6-month bucket list would consist of things like getting their financial affairs in order, spending quality time with family and friends, smelling some roses, drinking some champagne, and generally giving up. (Er, I mean, “acceptance”.)

I had already tried all of those answers out.

Unfortunately, it had had the undesirable effect that my financial planner had raised his fees, my family and friends had started getting annoyed at me for calling them at odd times, my neighbor (whose roses I was smelling) had started looking at me funny and my doctor had told me to cut down on the champagne!

\[ Ok, I know this book is supposed to be all about facts and logic, but please allow me a little liberty to be a tad overdramatic in the first chapter, just for fun. I promise, after this chapter is over, it is all going to be facts and logic until you start screaming for more drama! ]

Clearly the “6 months to live” question wasn’t working for me, though it made so much sense at first.

Still, there was clearly some truth to it. It did force one to seriously think and prioritize, but maybe it needed to be modified somehow before it became truly useful.

That’s when it occurred to me - I needed to extend the time frame! Instead of 6 months, I needed to ask: What would I do if I had 5 years to live?

Now that’s a far more interesting and useful question! Not to mention far less dread- and anxiety- inducing.

Extending the time frame to 5 years makes the question a lot more meaningful and actually harder to answer because the longer timeframe means there would be enough time to actually get some substantial and significant stuff done. A lot can be accomplished in 5 years.

Plus, the question is also far more realistic. Unless someone is already suffering from something serious, they can probably count on having at least 5 more years to live, right? Not to mention that medical miracles are making this possible even for many of those who may be suffering from serious ailments.

Of course, the extended time horizon comes with its own burden: You need to dig deep and see what it is that you really want to do in life or would regret not doing. With 5 years at your disposal, maybe you can still do it!

## Is Panicking a Good Way to Start? <a href="#moji7o31moi3" id="moji7o31moi3"></a>

In my case, the answer came to me one day in the shower. Just popped right out of thin (well, more like thick, to be frank, given I was in the shower) air, stood there in front of me and almost made me panic.&#x20;

The scenario that materialized in my mind was so scary, I had to gasp for breath!

Imagine you binge on a really great TV show all weekend. Then, when you see your coworkers on Monday, you start raving about it. You talk in great detail about all the wonderful characters and events and scenes, but, no matter how hard you try, you are simply unable to put it all together into a coherent story or plot or even a theme! Suddenly your excited recap of the show starts looking like just a grab-bag of unrelated stuff with no rhyme or reason to it.

That would make you feel like an idiot. What a waste of a whole weekend!

Now, imagine if this show had lasted for decades, not just a weekend. Hundreds of characters, thousands of episodes, millions of scenes, uncountable ups and downs, twists and turns, cliffhangers and dead ends. Many of them highly memorable and poignant, and yet, you are totally unable to string them all together into a meaningful whole.

Not being able to tell any sort of a comprehensive, coherent and in depth story about such an epic show wouldn’t just make you feel silly, it would be downright scary! Like you had suffered from a serious brain disorder or something. For decades!

Now imagine that this decades-long epic show was your actual life!

After having lived a life that lasted for many decades, if you were unable to describe what the whole thing was all about, that would make your whole life feel like a colossal waste of time! Not just to your bewildered coworkers but, even more seriously, for you yourself.

And I don’t mean just being able to tell a good and interesting story about your life, though that would be really important, too.

I mean not just the story, but the story behind the story. Not just the what, but the how and even the why.

You want to be able to say not just who were the characters and their personalities and motivations, but why they had those characteristics, personalities and motivations. You don’t just want to describe the scenes and the events, but how those scenes may have come about and why those events may have occurred.&#x20;

You want to get into great depth and explain everything that happened in a coherent, comprehensive and logical manner.

When it comes to something as important as your own life, you want to be like a historian, an anthropologist, a biologist and maybe even a physicist describing your whole life all the way from the ground up, with every step along the way explained in the most vivid detail possible.&#x20;

And ideally, you don't just want to do that for your own life, but to this whole amazing thing called life, the universe and everything.

As an aside, let me say that this way of thinking is known as Thinking from First Principles - when you try to explain things all the way from the most basic fundamentals. This concept forms a core principle of this book, and we will get deeper into what we mean by it and how we use it to formulate the ideas here in subsequent chapters.

Long story short, being able to tell the story of my life from First Principles became an obsession for me.&#x20;

This sort of a thing becomes even more urgent when you realize that this may be your only chance! YOLO, right?

I guess I could say that it was at this point in my life that I became an Eminem fan! Not only did his lyrics (included at the top of the chapter) suddenly make sense to me, but I could feel his sense of urgency and intensity.

I had been given this one shot, one opportunity, to seize everything I ever wanted. I wasn't going to let it slip. In fact, I consider myself really privileged to have been given this opportunity and stumbled on to these thoughts . It almost looked like it was my duty to seize it.

## Meaning and Purpose <a href="#jzbc6mlsgvu1" id="jzbc6mlsgvu1"></a>

So it was time for me to get to work.

How do I make sense of my life? What is its purpose? Does my life matter in the larger scheme of things?

What are the underlying principles, characters, motivations and rules behind Life, the Universe and Everything? Why does the universe do the things it does? Where is it going?

In other words, what did it all mean and why did it mean that? Was there a purpose behind any of it?

Well, isn’t this exactly what we mean when we ask about the “meaning” and “purpose” of one’s life or Life in general? What does it all mean and why does it mean that?

Of course, questions of this sort have probably been asked millions of times by millions of humans over thousands of years. And over the same period of time, many people have come up with some pretty interesting answers. Some of them have gone on to become extremely popular, even to the point of turning into religions and philosophies.

In the process, the even the meanings of the words "meaning" and "purpose" have changed. The words have taken on more theological or poetic or personal connotations, since their true meanings turned out to be too hard to discover.

But in my case, while that would have been the easy and maybe even a great way out, I didn’t want to just mumble some well-worn phrases from ancient books, or sing moving verses from some great poetry, or throw out some memes floating around in the zeitgeist that sounded cool. Not because they might have been wrong, but I had no way of knowing if they were right in the first place.

I am very much a scientist and engineer at heart. I have always been a highly analytical truth-seeking type person. I needed something far more solid than that. Anything less seemed like selling myself short.

I wanted to find honest, defensible answers to those questions, based on rigorous stepwise analysis, all the way from the ground up. No shortcuts, no leaps of faith, no hand waving, no opinions.

And if such a thing wasn't possible, I wanted to know that too. If there were limitations, I wanted to understand them. If there were some areas where we could say things for sure but some others where we couldn't, I wanted to know that too. I saw no point in just feeling warm and fuzzy by lying to myself. In my book, it is perfectly fine to not know things, as long as you admit it to yourself and know why that was the case.

It was important for me to feel that I didn't just have the correct answers, but I would be able to say why those were the correct answers.

A tall order, to be sure. Scary even. But once it popped into my head, it became an obsession.

## Answers, Entropy and Growth <a href="#wd89lyl62the" id="wd89lyl62the"></a>

It took quite a while to find and compile answers to these questions that could meet my criteria.

Still, I was surprised to find pretty much everything I wanted. Most of the answers already existed in some form. I had to add only a couple of things that were missing, organize everything systematically and apply what I would call the “engineering sensibility” to the collection to make  everything fit nicely together and make sense together.

As I got deeper into it, I kept discovering even deeper insights. Things that were fuzzy earlier became clearer and new avenues kept opening up, which led to further clarity as well as richness. I even discovered that I knew things I didn’t know I knew!

Towards the end of this exercise I found myself becoming more and more peaceful. Like a storm inside my head had started subsiding, the sun had started to peek out of the clouds, and the birds had started chirping again.

Not only that, but there was a bonus.

This exercise didn’t just give me answers to my questions, but pointed towards a better, more authentic way of life.&#x20;

Some of the popular quotes and parables that I had been taking for granted previously suddenly started making sense, while others lost their power over me.

Being an engineer, maybe I could describe the feeling as the entropy in my head subsiding and a new life-like growth taking its place. (Keep that image in your mind. We will be talking about entropy and life a lot in this book.)

The feeling was so nice that I felt I had to share it.

Long story short, the end result is this book, An Engineer’s Search for Meaning.

As the meme at the beginning of the chapter says, I just had to write this book, even if only for myself. By putting it out there, I am hoping it might appeal to someone else too.
