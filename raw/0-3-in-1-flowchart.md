# The Whole Book in One Flowchart



_“Concern for man and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors. Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and equations.”_

**― Albert Einstein, Quoted in "Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing our Digital Future" by Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson**



_“Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die, but long after we are gone be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistence.”_

**― Daniel Burnham, American architect**

Since I am an engineer, I like to draw diagrams / flowcharts to help me think and also to present my thinking to others. Here is a flowchart that captures how I have gone about deriving meaning, purpose and hope based on evidence and reason alone, starting from First Principles.

First, we define our methodology, and then use it to build a framework for achieving our purpose. I am calling it the Meaning-Seeking Entities (MSE) Framework. (The terms will be defined in the book.)

The framework starts with a discussion of our Ultimate Reality, followed by Physical Reality and Life on one side, and Consciousness on the other. We discuss the relevant evidence and reasoning behind our observations.

Based on that, we then define what we mean by the "6CED" Tendencies of the universe and Meaning-Seeking Entities (MSE).

Finally, this allows us to come up with rigorous, First-Principles-based definitions of meaning, purpose and hope that don't require you to take any leaps of faith or rely on someone's opinion.
