# Rude Q\&A



<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Q&#x26;A.jpg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Bring them on!</p></figcaption></figure>

_"I don't think there are any rude questions."_

**― Helen Thomas, American reporter and author, in the New York Times**



_"One handy technique I learned years ago at Microsoft was the Rude Q\&A (RQA). Whenever we had a major launch, we’d start preparing by writing a document that listed all of the difficult, unfair and perhaps rude, questions we’d rather not be asked, but might come up."_

**― Scott Berkun, American author, in his article "How and Why To Write a Rude Q\&A"**\




***







It is quite reasonable for anyone who comes across the ideas presented in this book to be confused, dismissive, incredulous or even annoyed. You probably have a lot of questions about everything presented here.&#x20;

I have tried to anticipate some of your questions, including some that might sound rude, and attempted to address them in advance. If you have a question that is not addressed here, please ask and I will add it to the list.

### A) Who are you? And why should anyone listen to you? <a href="#_34m7zm2y4g67" id="_34m7zm2y4g67"></a>

As far as this book is concerned, it shouldn't really matter who I am. And I am not asking you to listen to me or take my word for anything that is presented here.

I am not a philosopher or even an accomplished writer. I am a curious person at heart and an engineer by training. I started learning English in 5th grade, and somehow still developed a liking for writing in English. I have no particular authority in any of the fields I have talked about in this book, but I am a lifelong student who likes to dabble in a variety subjects.

The beauty of proposing a framework based on evidence and reason is that it does not require that I be an authority in the material presented. Anyone can verify the ideas presented here for themselves and agree or disagree based on whether their own exploration of the ideas convinces them.

Of course, it is quite likely that I have made mistakes in my construction of the MSE Framework, and in that case, I hope to hear about it, learn from it, and improve the framework accordingly. Doing so would be in line with the MBR methodology that the framework is based on.

Which brings us to the next question.

### B) What should someone do if they disagree with arguments presented in the book? <a href="#_ht391bjw8us8" id="_ht391bjw8us8"></a>

I love honest disagreements. That is how I discover new information and advance my base of knowledge. So go ahead and air your disagreements with me. I am happy to engage in any meaningful debate.

Unlike many other debaters, my aim in every meaningful debate I engage in is not so much to win the debate but to discover new truths.

In fact, I believe that when someone wins a debate, that means they have just wasted their time, because they did not learn anything new! One should prefer to lose an honest and rigorous argument, because that would mean that they learned something new and thus deepened their understanding of the issue. In my opinion, this is a far more interesting outcome.

Now let us talk about some similarities and differences between the approach presented here and the other well known approaches to answering the hard questions of life.

### C) Are you against faith or religion or spirituality in general? <a href="#_96kgr28kuih5" id="_96kgr28kuih5"></a>

Not at all. If someone believes in religion (or spirituality in general), I have no problem with that. I am not trying to convince them to give that up.

I think religion has been around for a long time, and for very good reasons. It has provided a source of meaning, purpose and hope to billions of people, I am trying to bring those benefits to those who have already lost faith in religion.

If someone has already moved on from their faith or never got too deep into it in the first place, and ended up having a meaning crisis as a result, then I hope my book will help them, just like it helped me.

Also, as I have noted earlier, there are some clear overlaps between what I have presented here and many religions and philosophies. Some of the final outcomes are very similar, except the methods used to get there are different, and, as discussed earlier, there are many additional benefits to the methods used here.

Using an approach based on evidence and reason and first principles allows us to understand why we are saying the things we are saying. We don't have to take leaps of faith or take someone's word for it. This approach allows us to challenge all the assumptions and the reasoning, and, if we learn something new, then improve the assumptions and reasoning.

This brings us to the next logical question.

### D) Is what you are proposing a new philosophy or ideology? <a href="#_w0i3snjwvh1u" id="_w0i3snjwvh1u"></a>

No.

What I am trying to define is just a scientific and engineering framework. I am not a philosopher or theologist by training, so I wouldn’t presume to make any serious proclamations in that area.

In my wildest dreams, I imagine that we will develop a new area of science and engineering that deals with "Meaning Seeking". I believe that we need something like this pretty badly at present and would love it if books such as this one motivate people in this direction.

Some day, maybe we will haveI high school or college level courses in this area. Such a course could probably parallel or follow immediately after students have gone through a good amount of STEM coursework. It could even provide additional motivation for students to take up these subjects.

I am not alone in undertaking this type of effort either. There are many others (as I have mentioned earlier) who have been working in this space. I am just another voice in that conversation.

But this gives me hope that something like this could happen in the near future.

### E) Are you just putting old wine in a new bottle? <a href="#_t4hou2ql383k" id="_t4hou2ql383k"></a>

Some people might say that the conclusions we have reached based on the MSE Framework look a lot like the teachings of many religions or philosophies that have existed for a long time.&#x20;

What is new here? Is this just old wine in a new bottle?

Let me use that analogy itself to explain what is new here. Suppose you want to get a great bottle of wine for some special occasion. You have 2 options:

1. You can go to the local wine store and ask the wine expert there for their recommendation and simply buy whatever they suggest. Or,
2. You browse through the isles and read the descriptions of the wines there. You might wonder, “What do all the terms and ratings and so on actually mean in reality? Are they trustworthy? Why? What makes one wine better than another? How is wine even made? How are grapes grown?” And so on.

If you want to know the answers to all these questions, you will need to learn quite a lot about wine making, viticulture, soil chemistry, geology, human taste and flavor perception, marketing tactics, and so on.

Essentially, you will need to understand wine making yourself from “First Principles”.

Of course, this is a lot harder and time consuming. But if you do that, you won’t have to take the wine expert’s word at the store.&#x20;

What if the wine expert isn’t as knowledgeable as they look? What if the expert is trying to push some wine at you because the winemaker gives them a kickback? What if the industrial wine manufacturing process is so bad for the wine that the entire inventory at the store is mediocre? What if there is a totally new way of winemaking that is far more robust and authentic? How would you know?

Only after having studied wine making from first principles would you understand enough to answer these questions honestly.

Now, I can totally understand someone who might say, “Why bother with all that? I’ll just drink the recommended wine and be happy!”

I have no problem with that. But I also understand that there are people like me who don’t want to take the word of the expert and want to get a lot deeper.&#x20;

As I explained in the “Motivation” chapter, people like me don’t just want the answers, they want to know why those are the right answers. We want to understand the story behind the story, the principles beneath it, and why those specific principles, to the extent possible.

If we do that, then we can not only find ideas that are far more reliable, but also there may be ways to communicate them better, to improve them, to resolve conflicts and so on.

### F) Why do you keep talking about engineering? Don’t most books of this type talk just about science or philosophy? <a href="#_bl6sx18aay7w" id="_bl6sx18aay7w"></a>

It is true that most other books of this type talk only about science or philosophy, rarely engineering.

Of course, science and engineering are joined at the hip, with a lot of overlap. But I would like to point out a few things that are different about engineering, which I rely on in this book, hence the need to mention it repeatedly.

The simplest reason for talking about engineering is that I am focused on finding a practical solution to the meaning crisis, which is a real problem in the world as well as for myself. Finding practical solutions to real problems is the domain of engineering. Science only helps us understand the rules of the game, that too only to the level possible.

The deeper reason is that engineering is better at dealing with complexity, nebulosity and unknowns than science. Science deals with clean abstractions, not messy reality.

This isn't so much a weakness of science, but a difference in objectives.

As we saw during our discussion on our methodology, if we are going to build something that deals with the messiness of reality, we need something like Mindful Bounded Rationality to do that. And engineering is far more aligned with this methodology than science.

Of course, you might say, we can add that methodology to science. But then it would be not different from engineering, so the question becomes moot.

Moreover, while the objective of science is to create abstractions that are fully buttoned down before making any serious claims, engineers can (and do) produce products and solutions that are in “beta” form. That means they are still being worked on and will keep improving.

This is exactly what I am doing here.

Finally, I don't believe any scientist has ever come up with a term like “6CED” to describe what they are doing. Such self-serving immaturity is the domain of engineers, and I am proud of that! :smile:

### G) Doesn't Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem prove that your rationality-based approach is doomed to failure?

No.

I have already covered this objection in a [Deep Dive on Gödel's theorem](4-methodology.md#\_z2598opt491e) in the chapter on Methodology.

### H) Doesn't the Is-Ought Problem prove that trying to define Purpose from first principles is doomed to failure?

No.

I have already covered this objection in a [Deep Dive on the Is-Ought Problem](10-purpose.md#deep-dive-the-is-ought-problem) in the chapter on Purpose.

### I) How is the MSE Framework different from Effective Accelerationism (e/acc)? <a href="#_o5wk6llj14dv" id="_o5wk6llj14dv"></a>

Effective Accelerationism is a fairly recent movement that happens to have some overlap with what I have proposed here, but there are some critical differences that make it totally different in reality.

Effective Accelerationism, in the words of their own activists, “seeks to align with the 'thermodynamic will of the universe' by embracing and accelerating the natural tendency of the universe towards growth, complexity, and higher intelligence. It encourages exploration, experimentation, and the advancement of civilization in the pursuit of greater utility and adaptability.”

As you can see, there is clearly some similarity with some of the "6CED" Universal Tendencies I have talked about.

But that's pretty much where the similarity ends.

The main point of difference between my proposal and theirs is that I am only proposing a framework that someone can use to find meaning, purpose and hope in their lives. It is not an ideology. There is no manifesto or commandments associated with the MSE Framework.

Also, I am explicitly accounting for limitations to rationality in my framework, which have led me to adopt Mindful Bounded Rationality as my methodology, rather than pure rationality. My hope in doing so is to avoid the hubris, excesses and absurdities that arise from taking rationality too far.

In my understanding, Effective Accelerationists are not humble about their ideology and are willing to extrapolate their ideas very far.&#x20;

Even a good idea, when taken very far, can turn into a bad idea. For example, every living being needs energy to survive, but too much will burn you. Some amount of water is essential for survival, but too much will cause a kidney failure.

This is not because these ideas themselves are bad, but because you are extrapolating them too far where they blow past some limitation, or your ability to predict their results is limited at best, or you are failing to acknowledge the delicate balance of multiple good ideas that is necessary to keep the entire system functioning.

In my opinion, taking rational thinking too far is actually irrational given all the limits to rationality we have talked about.

The effective accelerationists don’t talk much about mindfulness or the need to be grounded in reality or the need to fit abstractions to reality rather than the other way around.

Also, their ultimate aim seems to be to provide an ideological basis for accelerating the development of technology, which is radically different from my aim of helping people find meaning, purpose and hope in their lives.

Note that I am not at all against developing technology. I am an engineer, which means I develop technology. But what I am against is the almost religious zeal associated with accelerationism. It makes even rational people go to extremes and in fact, do irrational acts.

Also, in my opinion, technology does not need any help to accelerate itself. There are many factors in its favor already and at least in some cases, it is already accelerating faster than we can adjust.

In fact, it is humanity that is falling behind and needs to evolve in order to keep up, which is exactly what I am attempting to do here.

Here is another quote by Yuval Noah Harari that echoes the same sentiment:



> _"The danger is that if we invest too much in developing Al and too little in developing human consciousness, the very sophisticated artificial intelligence of computers might only serve to empower the natural stupidity of humans."_
>
> **― Yuval Noah Harari, Israeli Historian and author, in a tweet**



### J) How is the MSE Framework different from the Omega Point concept? <a href="#_9u3fx2wqdvwf" id="_9u3fx2wqdvwf"></a>

The Omega Point is a theorized future event in which the entirety of the universe converges toward a final point of unification. The term was invented by the French Jesuit Catholic priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.

This convergence is postulated based on ideas that are quite similar to the 6CED Tendencies that we have talked about.

Various people have characterized the Omega Point as a counterpoint to the idea of the heat death of the universe, which is what the law of entropy, taken to the extreme, entails.

Various other people have also expanded upon or modified the Omega Point idea to propose various related frameworks for finding meaning and purpose in life.

In contrast, what I am saying is that we do not need to justify any behavior in the present based on some extremely distant point in the future that we can not really predict to any level of certainty. (In fact, various scientists have proposed completely different theories about the end of the universe.)

The MSE Framework only relies upon what can be observed to be occurring right here, right now. This is a far more reliable guide because, here and now is where we have the maximum possible knowledge of our reality and there is no need to extrapolate things very far. We also have the maximum likelihood of carrying out any actions in the present than in the far future.

Once again, I think it is far more rational to acknowledge the limits of rationality and mitigate them, than trying to extrapolates things into the distant future.

And luckily for us, we have no need to extrapolate things into the distant future for the purpose of  creating definitions of meaning, purpose and hope.

### K) How does the MSE Framework relate to Spinoza’s idea of God? <a href="#_ejm5s9flw6s0" id="_ejm5s9flw6s0"></a>

There are some definite similarities between the MSE Framework and Spinoza's idea of God.

Baruch Spinoza was a 17th century European philosopher. He was one of the seminal thinkers of the Enlightenment and a strong proponent of Rationalism.

He proposed the idea that there is only one substance in the universe, and he called that substance God. Everything that exists is a part of this one substance, including you and me, rocks, trees, and everything else in the universe.

He argued that understanding our place in the interconnected web of the universe and aligning ourselves with it can lead to a kind of intellectual and emotional liberation, which leads to peace.

As you can see, what I have presented in this book is quite close to Spinoza’s argument, except I don’t call the universe or nature as God. (Though one could do that if that helps them.)

Also, Spinoza was a strong proponent of rationalism, whereas we have tried to moderate our reliance on rationality by incorporating elements of mindfulness and bounded rationality.

Moreover, we know a lot more about our reality today, based on an abundance of evidence and reason, than we knew in Spinoza’s time and we have taken full advantage of that in building our framework.

### L) How does the MSE Framework relate to the Hindu / Vedic philosophy of Brahman? <a href="#_3ugwkjz5a91" id="_3ugwkjz5a91"></a>

The Hindu / Vedic concept of Brahman also has many similarities with what I have presented.

According to this philosophy, Brahman is the ultimate, unchanging reality or cosmic principle that underlies the entire universe. It is often described as formless, infinite, eternal, and beyond all dualities and distinctions. Brahman is considered the source and essence of everything that exists.&#x20;

Under this philosophy, the purpose of life is to recognize our unity with Brahman and live accordingly.

As you can see, there are clearly a lot of overlaps between the MSE Framework and the conceptualization of Brahman.

One can also argue that our effort of trying to recognize our and the universe’s inherent 6CED Tendencies and live in alignment with them is similar to the aforementioned idea of aligning with the Brahman.

Where we differ is more in the details. There is no discussion of the 6CED Tendencies or anything like that in Vedic philosophy. This may just be a result of the fact that very little of the scientific knowledge that we know today was known at the time the Vedic ideas were developed.

In fact, the Vedic philosophy treats physical reality as an illusion and probably for that reason, they haven't tried to go too deep in explaining the various patterns that can be observed in it, which has been the focus of science and engineering.

Also, the Vedic philosophy considers our consciousness to be the same as Brahman. We haven't tried to make that claim and haven't needed to.

### M) How does the MSE Framework relate to Buddhism? <a href="#_9tradtxroxmm" id="_9tradtxroxmm"></a>

It is well known that Mindfulness is a central concept and practice within Buddhism. It involves the cultivation of present-moment awareness and non-judgment.

As we have seen, all of these are integral parts of the methodology we have used to build the MSE Framework, namely Mindful Bounded Rationality.&#x20;

We have also invoked mindfulness when talking about how to find meaning, purpose and hope in our lives. Mindfulness comes into play there due to the need to deal with complexity, nebulosity and unknowns in reality.

Also, according to Buddhism, suffering arises from not aligning oneself with reality. In our case, we are saying that aligning oneself with the 6CED Tendencies of the universe (including ourselves) is the way to attain a sense of meaning in one’s life. So clearly there is a lot of similarity there, too.

But once again, Buddhism hasn't focused a lot on explaining physical reality or coming up with crisp ideas of its tendencies. This is for the same reasons as mentioned above for the Vedic philosophy.

Also, Buddhism rejects the idea of a self, or consciousness. We, on the other hand, have postulated that consciousness may be a new "virtual" life form that we give birth to, and nurture during our lives.

Contrary to rejecting its existence, we embrace it and talk about expanding and enriching it.

### N) What is LifeVisor? <a href="#_z2598opt491e" id="_z2598opt491e"></a>

Aha! Finally a non-rude, even self-serving, question! :smile:

As you may have noticed, the URL for the book is "book.LifeVisor.ai". So what is this LifeVisor?

LifeVisor is the larger project that this book is a part of. I am still trying to define what it is going to be, but the motto for the project is "Helping smart people live wiser lives".

The idea is still evolving in my mind, and as it starts to materialize, you will be able to view at at the main project site: LifeVisor.ai.

You can also sign up for the mailing list on that page so you can be notified when things start to happen.



Ok, those are all the questions I have thought of so far. If you have additional questions, please ask and I will try to answer them here for everyone's benefit. And, once again, note that there are no rude questions as long as they are honest.
